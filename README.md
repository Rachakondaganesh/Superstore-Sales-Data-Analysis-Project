📊 Superstore Sales Data Analysis Project

A complete analysis of Superstore Sales data using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and Power BI for interactive dashboards.

This project uncovers insights into sales, profit, product performance, regional trends, and more — and presents them in an engaging dashboard format.

🧭 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data from a hypothetical “Superstore” to answer key business questions such as:

Which regions drive the highest sales and profit?

Which product categories / sub-categories are most profitable?

How does discounts or shipping cost affect profit?

What is the trend of sales over time (monthly, yearly)?

Are there patterns in customer segmentation, order priority, etc.?

The analysis is done in Python, and an interactive Power BI dashboard allows stakeholders to explore the findings dynamically.

💡 Key Analyses & Insights (Sample)

Sales & Profit by Region: Identified which regions consistently contribute most to revenue and margins.

Top Categories & Sub-Categories: Highlighted best-performing product lines.

Discount Impact: Explored how discounts correlate with profitability.

Time Series Trends: Showed growth/decline patterns in sales month-over-month and year-over-year.

Customer / Order Priority: Examined whether high-priority orders lead to better profits.

(You can replace this with actual insights you discovered.)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
Tool / Library	Purpose
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)	Data cleaning, transformation, and visualizations
Jupyter / .py script	Exploration, plotting, reporting
Power BI	Building an interactive dashboard with filters, slicers, and visuals
Git / GitHub	Version control & project hosting
🚀 How to Run / Use
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Rachakondaganesh/Superstore-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project.git
cd Superstore-Sales-Data-Analysis-Project

2. Python Analysis

Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly


Run the script:

python "py.code. Superstore Project.py"


or open it in Jupyter Notebook (if adapted) and run cell-by-cell.

Generated figures / charts will be displayed or saved (depending on your code).

3. Power BI Dashboard

Open PowerBI_Dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop

Interact with the visuals: filter by region, category, time period, etc.

Publish to Power BI Service if you want to share it online

📸 (Optional) Dashboard / Visualization Screenshots

Below are some sample visuals from the project and dashboard:

Python Visuals	Dashboard View
Sales by Region bar chart	Region filter + Map view of performance
Top Products pie chart	Category-wise profit slicer view
Trend line graphs	Monthly trend with drill-through

(You can insert images into your images/ folder and embed with Markdown like ![Sales by Region](images/sales_by_region.png).)

📊 Metrics & Widgets for README (Profile-style)

You can also add dynamic GitHub stats to your README (if this repo becomes your profile repo). For example:

![GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Rachakondaganesh&show_icons=true&theme=radical)
![Top Languages](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=Rachakondaganesh&layout=compact&theme=radical)

📈 Future Enhancements

Add predictive modeling (e.g. forecasting future sales using ARIMA or FBProphet)

Deploy a web dashboard (Streamlit / Dash) for interactive visualizations

Integrate map visuals (geospatial analysis by city/region)

Expand KPIs to include customer lifetime value, churn, RFM segmentation, etc.

Combine with external data (e.g. economics, holidays) to enrich analysis
